# Assigmnent-Tracker-Website
A website created in flask to track user assignments

This website was created using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/). <br>
To run this website for yourself, please download flask above. Then install all of the modules in the requirements.txt file so that you have the required modules to run this application

After this activate flask, which will usually be something like
```
$ source flask/bin/activate
```
depending on where your virtual environment is located. After this change directory to the folder containing the Assignment Tracker files. Then run these three commands
```
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

Now in the command line it should give you an IP address to view the website, but if it doesn't show this then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the application
